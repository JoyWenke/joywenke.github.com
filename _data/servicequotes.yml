- quote: 'I highly recommend Joy Wenke as a trainer! She is a dynamic presenter, and her years of school experience, especially with English Learners, make her a valuable resource to teachers and administrators alike. Joy is providing our professional development district-wide. She works collaboratively with me to design the course that best meets the particular needs of my district (not a “canned” presentation). The teachers thank me for bringing Joy to our district!'
